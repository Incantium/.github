## Contribution

The Incantium organization and its repositories is a closed community. We are not looking for development contribution
from the wider GitHub community at the moment.

Instead, you are always free to use our code. Mention our contribution if you want to; we would always greatly 
appreciate that. Give us new ideas, tips, even some issues you are having. We are always open to make our products the 
best they can be.

## Fun Facts

- Tip of the day: Unity is always buggy. Don't expect our code to alleviate that burden.
- Most of the time, we do not create games, just the tools that developers use. Could you call that game development?
- We here believe the tools we create shouldn't be monetized. Don't let your dreams be dreams ðŸŒˆ!
