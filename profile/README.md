## Contribution

The Incantium organization and its repositories are a closed community. We are not looking for development contribution
from the wider GitHub community.

Instead, you are always free to use our code. Mention our contribution if you want to; we would greatly appreciate that.
Give us new ideas, tips, even some issues you are having. We are always open to make our products the best they can.

## Fun Facts

- Tip of the day: Unity is always buggy. Don't expect our code to alleviate that thorn.
- Most of the time, we do not create games, just the tools that developers use. Could you call that game development?
- We here don't believe the tools we create should be monetized. Don't let your dreams be dreams!ðŸŒˆ
