## Fun Facts

- Tip of the day: Unity is always buggy. Don't expect or code to alleviate that thorn.
- Most of the time, we do not create game, just the tools that developers use. Is that really called game development?
- We here don't believe the tools we create should be monetized. Don't let your dreams to be dreams!ðŸŒˆ
